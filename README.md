### THE AUTHORS PROJECT
The project is devoted to people who would like to share their stories. The authors are the people who would like these voices to be heard in the western world without being censored or edited in any way. 
These stories are real and they come from real people from all over the world (from Ecuadorian rainforest tribes loosing their land, albinos in Africa being pursued by local residents because of religious reasons and lack of education, women in Bangladesh working for world famous fashion brands getting paid way too little and any other stories about violation of basic human rights which still take place in the XXI century). All of these stories will be assembled in books
___
The frontend part consists of several contact forms:
- tell story form which allows a user send messages directly to the authors gmail account with or without a file attached)
- contact form for those who would like to become a part of the authors and just give a hand in any area
- simple subscribe form

And there also is a form for the storybook preorder directly connected to payment form based on stripe payment system.
